  This is an app for lists of recurring events.  I found that there are many
things I used a traditional ToDo list format for, where I ended up getting
frustrated by having to re-enter the same activities or items month after
month, or week after week.  What do I mean?  Things like groceries:  although
there are always some deviations, in general I get the same few items every
time, or every other time, I go to the grocery store.  So why should I have to
re-enter those things every time I run out of them?  Instead, this app allows
the user to enter an item or event once, onto a custom list, and then toggle
whether it shows in the "done" or "needs to be done" portion of the list.

  How does it work?  On setup, enter in all of the grocerise you usually get.  As
you run out, toggle each item to "needs to be done".  When you finally go to the
store, as you pick up each item toggle it to "done".  Over the course of the
next week(s), toggle each item back to "needs to be done" as you run out.  
  
  This model works for things like chores, too.  I wish it weren't the case, but
things like the kitchen and bathroom never stay clean, the bills need to be
paid each month, and my mom likes me to call her every once in a while.  So
those things can be set up in a "chores" list, where chores are toggled to
"need to be done" as it becomes obvious that, say, your tub is developing its
own ecosystem, and then toggled to "done" once you massacre the alien
lifeforms growing on your dirty dishes.  And then toggle them back to "needs
to be done" as the process repeats itself.  
  
  05_01_2012:  This app is in the very earliest stages.  Eventually this will be
ported to use Core Data (whether or not Core Data is strictly necessary, this
is a teaching tool for me, as well as a passion project and potential appstore
submission, so I will add Core Data just to get more familiarity with it).
